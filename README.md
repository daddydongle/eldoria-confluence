# Eldoria: Confluence

A dependency-free Canvas starter prototype for a fantasy action RPG. The opening tutorial begins in an Eldorian meadow, introduces an intentionally unwinnable Blood Cult encounter, and continues with a prison escape and optional Blood Essence pickup.

## Play locally

Open `index.html` directly, or serve the folder with any static web server (for example `python -m http.server 8000`) and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Controls

- **WASD / arrows** — move
- **Shift** — sprint
- **Q** — dash
- **Space or J** — unarmed/knife attack
- **H** — block/use shield
- **F** — interact
- **O** — inventory
- **` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = E R T Y U I [** — ability slots 1–20. The requested sequence supplies 19 distinct keys, so `[` completes slot 20.

## Tutorial flow

1. Dismiss the arrival message in the flowered meadow.
2. Receive **New objective: Survive** and face Blood Cultists, a Blood Priestess, and the High Priest. The encounter is deliberately unwinnable.
3. Wake in a prison cell after the defeat fade.
4. Search the meal tray with **F** to find a knife, then use it at the barred door.
5. Pick up the Blood Essence. It is stored in the searchable/filterable inventory and is never consumed automatically.

## Architecture

- `index.html` — Canvas, HUD, story, inventory, and confluence overlays
- `styles.css` — responsive dark-fantasy presentation and placeholder gem-convergence animation
- `data.js` — canonical 20-essence/100-ability catalogue, 20-key mapping, and progression rules
- `game.js` — game loop, input, combat, enemy AI, state transitions, prison interaction, and inventory
- `assets/characters/player/default/player-atlas.png` — four-direction player animation atlas with idle, walk, sprint, attack, block, and defeated states

The progression model enforces three core essences plus one confluence essence. Completing the build unlocks the first ability from each essence (four total); awakening stones then unlock the remaining sixteen, producing twenty abilities in the build. Mechanical implementations for essence abilities are intentionally scaffolded for later development.

## GitHub Pages

This repository is already static-site ready. In GitHub, open **Settings → Pages**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, then select `main` and `/ (root)`. No build step is required.
